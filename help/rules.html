      <p>The object of the game is to remove all 144 tiles. A tile may only be removed if:
         <ul>
            <li>it does not have any tiles on top of it;</li>
            <li>there are no tiles either to its left or right, or both;</li>
            <li>it matches another tile which meets the above criteria (i.e. it is open).</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Two tiles match if they are of the same suit and rank, except for season and flower tiles, which match any tile of the same suit.</p>
      
      <p>A fireworks display is shown after all tiles have been removed.</p>
